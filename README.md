# Materia-Black-Colors for Mailspring

Like the GTK theme so decided to try to implement it in Mailspring.

Comments are included in the ui-variables.less file showing how
to select to color you want.

Drop this into your ~/.config/Mailspring/packages folder and 
it should be selectable as a theme.
